# Sample configuration file for Polipo. -*-sh-*-

# You should not need to use a configuration file; all configuration
# variables have reasonable defaults.  If you want to use one, you
# can copy this to /etc/polipo/config or to ~/.polipo and modify.

# This file only contains some of the configuration variables; see the
# list given by ``polipo -v'' and the manual for more.


### Basic configuration
### *******************

# Uncomment one of these if you want to allow remote clients to
# connect:

# proxyAddress = "::0"        # both IPv4 and IPv6
# proxyAddress = "0.0.0.0"    # IPv4 only

# If you do that, you'll want to restrict the set of hosts allowed to
# connect:

# allowedClients = 127.0.0.1, 134.157.168.57
# allowedClients = 127.0.0.1, 134.157.168.0/24

# Uncomment this if there's only one user using this instance of Polipo:

cacheIsShared = false
dontTrustVaryETag = true

# Uncomment this if you want to use a parent SOCKS proxy:

socksParentProxy = "localhost:1080"
socksProxyType = socks5

# Uncomment this if you want to scrub private information from the log:

# scrubLogs = true
# logLevel = 255


### Memory
### ******

# Uncomment this if you want Polipo to use a ridiculously small amount
# of memory (unit in bytes):

# chunkHighMark = 819200
# objectHighMark = 128

# Uncomment this if you've got plenty of memory:

chunkHighMark = 100663296
objectHighMark = 32768

# Access rights for new cache files.
diskCacheFilePermissions=0640
# Access rights for new directories.
diskCacheDirectoryPermissions=0750


### On-disk data
### ************

# Uncomment this if you want to disable the on-disk cache:

diskCacheRoot = ""


### Domain Name System
### ******************

# Uncomment this if you want to contact IPv4 hosts only (and make DNS
# queries somewhat faster):

dnsQueryIPv6 = no

# Uncomment this to disable Polipo's DNS resolver and use the system's
# default resolver instead.  If you do that, Polipo will freeze during
# every DNS query:

dnsUseGethostbyname = yes
dnsGethostbynameTtl = 180m


### HTTP
### ****

# censoredHeaders = set-cookie, cookie, cookie2, from, accept-language
# censorReferer = true

# Uncomment this if your user-agent does something reasonable with
# Warning headers (most don't):

relaxTransparency = maybe
serverIdleTimeout = 60s
serverSlots = 8
serverSlots1 = 16
smallRequestTime = 20s
serverTimeout = 3m
clientTimeout = 3m2s

# Uncomment this if you want to add a no-transform directive to all
# outgoing requests.

# alwaysAddNoTransform = true
disableServersList = false
